// null =>  null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other languages. It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.
// undefined => The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”
// symbol =? The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. We have to mention it here for the sake of completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects
// object => objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.

console.log(typeof null); // Object
