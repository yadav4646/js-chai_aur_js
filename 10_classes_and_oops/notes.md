## 4 pillars

Abstraction
-Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the practice of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features to the user. In JavaScript, abstraction is achieved by using abstract classes and interfaces.

Encapsulation
-Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of an object from other objects and code. In JavaScript, encapsulation is achieved by using closures and access modifiers, such as the private and public keywords.

Inheritance
-Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows developers to create a new class that inherits properties and methods from an existing class. In JavaScript, inheritance is achieved by using the prototype property and the Object.create() method.

Polymorphism
-Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways. In JavaScript, polymorphism is achieved by using function overloading and function overriding.
